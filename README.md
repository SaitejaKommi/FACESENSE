FaceSense
AI-Powered Facial Recognition–Driven Attendance Management System
📌 Overview

FaceSense is an intelligent, AI-powered attendance management system that leverages facial recognition to automatically identify individuals and record attendance. By integrating computer vision and machine learning, FaceSense eliminates manual attendance processes, minimizes proxy attendance, and significantly improves accuracy and efficiency.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional attendance systems are often:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Susceptible to manipulation and proxy attendance

FaceSense addresses these challenges by offering a contactless, automated, and reliable attendance solution using facial biometrics.
