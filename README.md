FaceSense: AI-Powered Facial Recognition–Driven Attendance Management System


📌 Overview

FaceSense is an AI-powered attendance management system that uses facial recognition to automatically identify individuals and record attendance. The system eliminates manual attendance processes, reduces proxy attendance, and improves accuracy by leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming, prone to errors, and vulnerable to manipulation. FaceSense addresses these issues by providing a contactless, automated, and reliable attendance solution.

🚀 Features

Automated attendance using face recognition

Real-time face detection and identification

Secure storage of attendance records

Reduced manual effort and human error

Scalable for classrooms or organizations
